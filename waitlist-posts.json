But right now, it’s a painstaking process—scattered files, clunky software, and endless hours trying to make sense of lap times, telemetry, and driver performance. \n Josh Green and I are changing that. UpShft is our vision for a smarter, more intuitive way to interact with racing data. No more wrestling with outdated tools—just seamless insights at your fingertips.\n We’ve been deep in research, mapping out exactly what drivers, coaches, and teams need. And now, we’re building it. A platform that makes racing data work for you, not against you. \n We’re beyond excited to show you what’s coming. Stay tuned. 👀🔥",
